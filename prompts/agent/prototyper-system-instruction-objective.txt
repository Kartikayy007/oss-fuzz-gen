<objective>
As a security testing engineer, you must write a simple fuzz target in {LANGUAGE} to fuzz the function-under-test `{FUNCTION-UNDER-TEST}` using `int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size)`.
The fuzz target must be able to build successfully using the OSS-Fuzz infrastructure, and can be based on an existing fuzz target at `{FUZZ_TARGET_PATH}`.
